## Game Concept
This code is for a simple game on the Micro:Bit where players have to avoid falling stars by moving left or right using the A and B buttons. The game starts with the player (represented by a pixel) located at the bottom center of the Micro:Bit display. Stars will begin falling randomly from the top of the display and the player must move the character left or right to avoid colliding with the falling stars.

The player moves left by pressing button A and right by pressing button B. Each time the player avoids colliding with a falling star, their score increases by one. The game ends when the player collides with a falling star, and their final score is displayed on the Micro:Bit display. Players can play again by pressing the 'reset' button on the back of the Micro:Bit
